# React_Day3

Day 3 of my Full Stack MERN training focused on strengthening core React fundamentals and building small practical projects to reinforce learning.

---

## Topics Covered

- **Creating a Quiz System**  
  Managed user selections and scoring dynamically using React state and event handlers.

- **State Management using Hooks**  
  Practiced `useState`, `useEffect`, and `useRef` to enable dynamic UI updates and interactivity.

- **Working with APIs in React**  
  Used `fetch()` inside `useEffect` to retrieve data from public APIs and render dynamic content.

- **React Routing with Parameters**  
  Implemented multi-page navigation using React Router (`BrowserRouter`, `Routes`, `Route`), and extracted dynamic parameters with `useParams()`.

- **Component Reusability & Conditional Rendering**  
  Built modular components for counters, inputs, and validations with conditional display.

- **Basic Carousel Implementation**  
  Created an image slider with navigation buttons and index tracking.
